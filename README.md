# messenger-cmd
Command Prompt Messenger is a .cmd file that basically works as a messenger. It uses the msg command and as of version 2.0 it can use net send command. It supports two diffrent "interfaces" legacy and future (this is what i called them), and the diffrence between them is the send command. Program comes in two versions, Light and Release the light version is without lodaings aka the fast one and the Release version is the full program with loadings (that i'm going to speed up or remove). It is still in development.
#Usage
The program is quite simple and has notes on how to use it built-in. I'm planning to implement the instructions into the program to make it more user-friendly. As for now these are the instructions for version 2.0:
 1. Run the program and wait till it loads.
 2. Select the interface. (Future works for most OS as i discovered)
 3. Type in computer name/IP example: MIKE-COMP / 192.168.1.103 and press ENTER
 4. Type in the messege and press ENTER. The Program will then send the messege. It will be displayed for 20 seconds (this might change in future updates)
 5. Press Any key to continue and you will be taken back to messege input. If you want to send messege to someone else type: restart in the messege.
 
#Future
I plan to make it more advanced here's the ToDo List:
 - Add somekind of Main Menu
 - Add Ability to change colors
 - Make it more user friendly
 - Fix all bugs (if exist)
 More will be coming soon...
 
That's it! Hope you like the program!
